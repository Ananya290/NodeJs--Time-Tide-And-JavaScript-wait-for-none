Topic: “JavaScript on the Server & The Magic Behind Node.js” 

 

1. Introduction 

Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, mainly on the server. 

Earlier, JS was limited to browsers — now it can run anywhere. 

 

2. What is a Server? 

A server is just another computer (CPU) located remotely. 

It receives requests and sends responses (like when you open google.com). 

Example: 

You → Client → Request google.com 

Maps to IP (e.g., 114.265.123.8) 

That IP points to Google’s server → response comes back. 

3. Client & Server Relationship 

Client: Your browser/computer (frontend) 

Server: The machine hosting the website (backend) 

4.JavaScript Before Node.js 

JavaScript was only used in browsers → for frontend. 

Backend used languages like Java, Python, C++, etc. 

Node.js changed everything — you can now use JS both frontend & backend. 

Hence the term Full Stack Developer. 

Example: MERN / MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). 

5. Node.js Popularity Reason 

One language (JavaScript) for both frontend & backend = easier development. 

Full Stack JS became the trend. 

6. The Secret Behind Node.js 

🔥 Node.js is not written in JavaScript! 

It’s actually written in C++. 

It embeds the V8 JavaScript Engine (made by Google). 

V8 itself is also written in C++. 

So at the core: 

Node.js → C++ program 

    ↳ contains V8 engine (C++) 

         ↳ executes JavaScript 

 

7. What is V8 Engine? 

V8 is Google’s open-source high-performance JavaScript engine. 

Written in C++. 

Used in Chrome and Node.js. 

Converts JavaScript → machine code that the CPU understands. 

It follows ECMAScript standards (the official JavaScript rules). 

Shape 

8. ECMAScript — The JavaScript Standard 

ECMAScript = the specification / rulebook for JavaScript. 

Defines syntax, keywords, features (like let, const, ===, ternary, etc.). 

Maintained by TC39 Committee (39 experts from big companies). 

Different JS engines (V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra, JavaScriptCore) must all follow ECMAScript. 

That’s why JS runs the same everywhere. 

Why Node.js Was Needed 

V8 can only run JS that follows ECMAScript — no file system, no database, no network access. 

Node.js adds extra powers (APIs) on top of V8 to allow: 

File System access 

Network (HTTP requests) 

Databases 

OS-level tasks 

These are Node.js built-in modules (like fs, http, path, etc.). 

So Node.js = 

V8 Engine + Extra C++ APIs (Superpowers) 

10. Node.js Composition 

Node.js repository: 

~62% JavaScript (for APIs) 

~21% C++ (for core engine) 

Inside its dependencies folder → you’ll find the V8 engine source. 

11. The Big Picture (Layered View) 

Your JS Code (Frontend / Backend) 

        ↓ 

V8 Engine (C++) executes it 

        ↓ 

Machine Code / Binary (understood by CPU) 

So: 

JS → C++ → Machine code → Processor executes 

12. Why C++ at the Core? 

Because the computer ultimately understands binary (0s and 1s). 

C++ sits closer to hardware, can manage memory, and is faster. 

JS → interpreted by V8 → converted to machine-level code → executed. 

13. Summary 

JavaScript is a high-level language. 

V8 Engine is a C++ program that runs JS. 

Node.js is another C++ program with V8 inside it + extra server APIs. 

Node.js = JavaScript Runtime Environment → lets you run JS anywhere.

15. Final Thoughts 

Every time you write console.log("Hello World") in Node.js: 

Your code → processed by V8 (C++) 

Converted into machine code 

Run by the CPU 

Appreciate how many layers work behind one simple line!
