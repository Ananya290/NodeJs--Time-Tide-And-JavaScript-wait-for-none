History of NodeJs 

 

Node.js = JavaScript + V8 Engine + Event Loop + Non-blocking I/O 
Created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl to make web servers faster, scalable, and efficient. 

Back in Time — When JavaScript Lived Only in Browsers 

A long time ago, JavaScript was just a browser language. 
It could make buttons work, handle forms, add animations — but it could not run outside the browser. 
If you wanted to build a backend, you had to use other languages like Java, Python, or PHP. 

So, the web world was divided — 
Frontend = JavaScript 
Backend = Everything else 

 

Enter Ryan Dahl — The Creator 

In 2009, a developer named Ryan Dahl was frustrated. 
He looked at how traditional web servers like Apache worked. 

In Apache, every new request created a new thread. 
Threads consume memory, and handling thousands of users meant thousands of threads — 
⚠️ which made servers slow and heavy. 

Ryan thought, 

“Why can’t we have a server that handles thousands of users with just one thread?” 

He wanted a system that could handle I/O operations (like reading files, making network requests, accessing databases) without blocking other work. 

 

The Spark — Using JavaScript Outside the Browser 

At that time, Google had developed a super-fast JavaScript engine for Chrome — 
the V8 Engine, written in C++. 
Ryan realized: 

“What if I take the V8 engine and run it outside the browser?” 

He first experimented using Firefox’s SpiderMonkey engine, 
but then quickly switched to Google’s V8 because it was much faster. 

And that’s how he created a new runtime — 
👉 Node.js 

What Made Node.js Special 

Node.js brought some revolutionary ideas: 

Event-driven architecture – everything runs based on events. 

Non-blocking I/O – it doesn’t wait for one task to finish before starting the next. 

Single-threaded model – one thread can handle thousands of requests efficiently through an event loop. 

This model allowed Node.js to be super fast and lightweight, perfect for real-time applications like chats, live streaming, and APIs. 

The Rise of Node.js 

2010 → npm (Node Package Manager) was launched — allowing developers to share open-source packages easily. 

Node.js got huge community support and backing from the company Joyent. 

It became the favorite for startups and companies like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and LinkedIn. 

Now developers could use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, making development smoother and faster. 

 

Ryan Dahl’s Reflection 

Years later, in 2018, Ryan Dahl gave a talk called “10 Things I Regret About Node.js”. 
He mentioned a few design mistakes — like the node_modules system and some API design issues — 
and from those learnings, he built a new runtime called Deno (an anagram of Node).
